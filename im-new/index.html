    <h3>Plan Your Visit</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We have two service times available 9:30am and 11:15am
        <ul>
          <li>Children’s ministry is available in our first service</li>
          <li>Nursery is available in both services</li>
          <li>Youth group meets at 12:30pm</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When you arrive at the main campus entrance, there will be Christ Central sandwich boards and banners that will direct you to the main parking lot closest to our worship facility. There is plenty of parking!</li>
      <li>If you have kids, you can check them in at our ‘Check - In’ station. You will receive a name tag with a special code. This unique code will be used to contact you in case of emergencies and is a safe way to reconnect you with your child from class during dismissal time. We bring our children into worship and will dismiss them after the children’s sermon. </li>
      <li>Coffee and pastries will be available before and after worship. If you have any questions, our welcoming team will be able to assist you. They will be wearing a blue shirt that says ‘Welcome’ on it. </li>
