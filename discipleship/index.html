    <p><em>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

    <h4 class="mb15">What is it? What’s the commitment?</h4>
    <p class="mb30">Christ Central’s intentional discipleship is Christian mentorship where we equip our members to love God and love neighbor in a personal setting. We aim to grow in God’s word, applying it to our lives, and training followers of Jesus Christ in order to reach and train others. </p>
    <h4 class="mb15">How long is a group?</h4>
    <p class="mb30">One year of growing with a small group,  learning how to love God and love neighbor, and training one another for not only the next year, but generations to come.</p>
    <h4 class="mb15">What’s the end goal?</h4>
    <p class="mb30">We hope to have every member at Christ Central more confident in your faith in God, humble in your walk with Christ, and eager to love others in their community.</p>
    <h4 class="mb15">Who can apply?</h4>
    <p>Due to our initial stages of discipleship and the number of leaders, this 2022-2023 season will give priority to Christ Central members. If you have any personal questions, please email <a href="mailto:pastorin@christcentralsf.com"><br/>pastorin@christcentralsf.com</a>.</p>
