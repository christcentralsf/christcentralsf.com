      Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. - 2 Corinthians 9:6-7
    </p>
    <p>God’s Word shows us both the responsibilities and the blessings of giving. Everything we have including our time, money, and abilities comes from God. We are merely stewards of what God has entrusted to us. Thus, giving is an act of worship and an acknowledgement of God’s kindness and provision for us.</p>
    <p class="mb60">Scripture teaches that the tithe is a tenth of all that God has given us. It is 10% of our money, but it is also a tenth of the time we are allotted and a tenth of the “talents” or skills we have been given. Your financial tithe to our church, along with your unrestricted gifts, are used to support the vision of the church: to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, to be a Christ-centered community and to fulfill the Great Commission in the Bay Area and the world for the glory of God.</p>
