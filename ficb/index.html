  </div>
  <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center">
    <p>Fellowship in Christ, Berkeley (FiCB) is the campus ministry of Christ Central Presbyterian Church. We meet regularly both in large and small group settings. The goal of our ministry is to shape our members into “real Christians in the real world” – that is, to be transparent and authentic citizens of Heaven and of Earth – so that our knowledge and faith in Christ would remain firm when we leave the university setting for the work place.</p>

    <h3 class="mb15">Large Group</h3>
    <p>During the school year, FiCB meets on campus every Wednesday evening for praise, sermons, and fellowship. While providing an opportunity to get to know all members of FiCB, Large Group is also a great time of weekly worship in addition to Sunday service at Christ Central.</p>

    <h3 class="mb15">Community Groups</h3>
    <p>Community Groups are an essential part of FiCB’s ministry in Berkeley. The goal is to grow together by understanding “who we are” because of God’s work in and through Jesus and to live out our Identity through “what we ought to do” with our family on mission together in Berkeley.</p>

    <h3 class="mb15">Prayer Meetings</h3>
    <p>In addition to small groups and large groups, FiCB members also participate in class prayer meetings. Prayer meetings are held once every month (the exact dates/times depending on each class), and are a good way to meet with students in your own class for prayer and accountability.</p>
