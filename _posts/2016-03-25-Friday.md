##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  To satisfy her physical thirst the Samaritan woman came to draw water, but in her encounter with Jesus she realized her spiritual dehydration, her spiritual need. Have you had a life experience that led you to a similar spiritual realization?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. Because Jesus knows your deepest and greatest need, the gospel is personal. Jesus saw that the great sadness in this woman’s spiritual life who had been through many failed relationships and yet found no satisfaction. Have you ever encountered Jesus in this kind of intimate and personal manner? If so, how?  
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. "You will never be thirsty again" (v. 13). How does Jesus keep this promise? Read John 19:28-30. The Gospel not only reveals our greatest need but it also reveals the richness of Jesus' love and mercy. He took this woman's thirst, her greatest need, and paid the ultimate price to quench her soul's thirst. What is your story of Jesus; grace? Have you experienced this kind of satisfaction in your soul?     
{: .community-group-questions}

4\.  "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25). What is the meaning and implication of Jesus' resurrection in your life?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\.  We are witnesses of His resurrection. That means we know the answer to humanity’s greatest need.  Name one person that you want to witness Christ to.  Let's pray for each other so that we may support and keep each other accountable.
