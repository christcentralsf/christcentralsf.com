16 And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. 17 And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 18 And they began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 19 And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. 20 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.

21 And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 22 And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). 23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 24 And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. 25 And it was the third hour when they crucified him. 26 And the inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.” 27 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. 29 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!” 31 So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself. 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.

## Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions .name}

1) Have you truly experienced shame and disgrace? What is your most humiliating moment/story?   
{: .community-group-questions}

## Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions .name}

2) Mark focuses, more so than the physical of the cross, on shame an disgrace of Jesus' cross. In what ways did the people mentioned (i.e. the soldiers (vv. 16-20, 23-24), the people (v. 29), the chief priests (v. 31), and the criminals (v. 32)) insult Jesus? 
{: .community-group-questions}

3) Read Gal 3:13. What does it mean "Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree"? What does it mean that Jesus became a curse for us? 
{: .community-group-questions}

4) Jesus was reviled and humiliated through and through. Yet, he remains silent. Why? What does the cross represent to those who believe in him? (Read 1 Peter 2:23-25)

## Application

5) Jesus took your cross, your shame and disgrace, and he died for us. And now Jesus calls his disciples to pick up our cross and follow him. What does that mean to you?

6) Is the old rugged cross the most beautiful and important thing in your life?
