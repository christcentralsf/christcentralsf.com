##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  Have you ever experienced the power and wonder of Jesus and been blown away by His greatness?  What triggered that experience?
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. What is the real message of Pentecost?  (vv. 32-36).  What does it mean to know with certainty that Jesus is both Lord and Savior?  What personal implications does this have?  
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. The Spirit (a mighty rushing wind, v. 2) and the reversal of the Babel curse (v. 4) point to a new creation and a new beginning for church.  What distinguishes the church from the world? What changes can we make as a church to be more Gospel-centered?     
{: .community-group-questions}

4\.  Read John 16:14, 15.  What is the role and ministry of the Holy Spirit?  What was the focus of Peter's sermon in Acts? (v. 38).  Do you truly believe that Jesus is both Lord and Savior?  If so, what is the implication?   
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\.  The message of Pentecost is utterly Christocentric (Gospel-centered and Christ-centered).  What does it mean for you to be "Christ-centered"?  How will that change your life?
