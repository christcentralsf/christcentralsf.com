##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  What's the worst illness that you have ever had? What sort of trouble and inconvenience did you experience and what did you learn from it?
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\.  The lame beggar's condition points to our own spiritual condition. His paralysis depicts our spiritual helplessness before God. In what ways are we spiritually sick? (Read Mark 2:17)
{: .community-group-questions}

3\.  The beggar looked at the disciples expecting to receive something from them (v. 5).  He was only seeking alms as a temporary relief to his problem. What are some common yet wrong expectations we have from God? 
{: .community-group-questions}

4\.  Read v. 6 and v.16. What is the promise given in Jesus? What is the "perfect health" that he is referring to? Does the Gospel truly transcend all your expectations? Why or why not?
{: .community-group-questions}


##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\.  We often take the gospel for granted. Do you really believe in your heart that your salvation is the greatest miracle that has taken place in life? Why or why not? How can we practically show and grow more in appreciation of His grace?
