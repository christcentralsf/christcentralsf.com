To better care for your children, students 0-5 years old in the Guppies, Tadpoles, Starfish, and Seahorses classes will no longer gather in the garage. After being dismissed from the sanctuary, parents will need to walk their child to class, sign them in and drop them off.

##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\. Share one particular passion you have in life. What are things about it that you like to "sing its praises"? How do you share that passion with others? 
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. In Acts 1:6, the disciples showed a clear misunderstanding of the gospel and Jesus’ kingdom.  In what ways, do we make the same mistake? How does your mission in life differ from Jesus' mission?   
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. Jesus calls his disciples---his church---to be His witnesses. Read Matthew 28:18-20. What is required and implied in his commission?
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Fear hinders our evangelism. What fears do you have when it comes to sharing your faith? What is the significance of Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit, and how does he empower and enable you to share the gospel?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\. Each and every one of us are a masterpiece of God created to do good works. As witnesses each of us are specialized instruments, meaning that there are hands only you can hold, people only you can reach, and hearts only you can heal. Who are the people God has specifically made and developed you to reach? Let's pray for them and make practical commitments to win them over to Christ.
