##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  God often teaches you something important during your waiting experience. Have you ever had those "waiting experiences" and what did you learn from it?   
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. What is the significance of the apostles returning to Jerusalem (v. 12)? What else do we learn about obedience in this passage? What is your own understanding of obedience in the Christian life?  
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. One distinguishing mark of this waiting community was their prayer (v. 14, 24). Why did they pray and what do we learn about prayer in this passage? Do we struggle with prayer in our Christian walk? If so, why?   
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Casting lots (Proverbs 16:33; 18:18) was a method used to determine the will of God. Ultimately, it was their way of submitting to Jesus' authority and ruling in their life. What areas of your life do you struggle to submit to Jesus' authority?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\.  The Gospel gives you a new identity and new purpose in life: "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." What does that mean to you?  What does it mean to live your life as a witness of Jesus?
