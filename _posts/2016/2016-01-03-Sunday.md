{: .community-group-questions}

2\. Read John 17:18. What is the significance of the parallelism between Jesus' mission and ours? 
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. Jesus designates "the world" as our mission field. What and who is in "your world" that you can share the gospel with? 
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Read Ecclesiastes 3:9-15, what are the pundit's observations & thoughts? Have you ever reflected upon these thoughts on your own?

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\. "So let it be with you, Christian people. Your one business in life is to lead men to believe in Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit, and every other thing should be made subservient to this one objectiv; if you can but get them saved, everything else will come right in due time" (Charles H. Spurgeon) How can we make this the central mission/goal/purpose in life? Pray for one person whom you desire to see come to the Lord.
