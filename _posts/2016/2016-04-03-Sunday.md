##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  Share one success story of your transformation (habits, lifestyle, addictions, commitment, etc). What did it take to change and what was the lesson that you learned from it?
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. "They were cut to the heart" (v. 37). Repentance requires demolishing your old life and laying down the new foundation of the gospel. What does that look like in your life and why is it necessary for every Christian?  
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. True repentance brings a sincere, wholehearted commitment: "Brothers, what shall we do?" (v. 37). They were willing to do whatever it takes to change their life. Why do we have commitment issues and how does the Gospel help us overcome the fear of commitment?    
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

4\.  As a church, we must seek repentance on a daily basis, to keep what is good and seek continuous improvement. What are our strengths and weakness, and what changes do you desire to see happen at Christ Central?
{: .community-group-questions}

5\.  Corporate change begins with the individual. What do you need to repent of and change to bring about true repentance at Christ Central? How do you see yourself in this movement of "Building a Church for Others"? Let's make some practical commitments so we can keep each other accountable in our CGs.
