##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  In what areas have you been maturing in the Lord?  Share some areas of personal spiritual growth that God is sowing and nurturing in your life. 
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. How is Jesus' teaching on the Christian life different from our own expectations? (v. 33).  Read 2 Timothy 4:16-17.  What important lesson or blessings do we learn from our struggles?  Have you ever experienced the Lord's presence in your times of difficulty?  If so, when?
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. Read Hebrews 11:1.  How does faith help us overcome our doubt in times of struggle?  What assurances and convictions does the Gospel provide for believers?
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Read Philippians 4:10-13.  What is the source of Christian joy?  Paul says he has learned to be content in all situations. (v. 11)  What is the secret to his contentment? (2 Cor 12:9)
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\. The Gospel is our spiritual nourishment for maturity and growth.  Paul confessed, "By the grace of God I am what I am" (1 Cor 15:10).  What does that mean?  How does that change your life?
