##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\. Have you ever been touched or affected by someone else's giving? What was the best gift you've ever received?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. Jesus came not to be served but to serve and to give away his life. He also taught that if anyone wants to be great then they must become a servant to all. How is the gospel counter-intuitive and counter-cultural? Why is "giving" at the crux of the gospel?   
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. Read 2 Cor 9:6-7. Though God loves a cheerful giver, we often struggle to cheerfully give. What is the fundamental issue for this, and why do we struggle to give? How does the gospel change that?  
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. God promises Abraham, "I will bless you to be a blessing to all". In light of that promise, what is the purpose of God's blessings to us? What must change for us to serve and be a blessing to others? 
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\. Ultimately, the reason we give is because we're compelled by the love of Jesus. In what practical ways can we give? Jesus evangelized (shared the gospel) by giving away his life. What are some practical actions we can learn from our Master?
