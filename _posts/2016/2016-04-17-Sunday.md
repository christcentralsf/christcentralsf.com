{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35).  Have you ever experienced the joy of giving?  How were you able to help and encourage someone else?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. “All who believed were together” (v. 44).  What was so significant about this gathering? From its make up, what do we learn about a Gospel-community? (Read Ch. 2:9-11).  Read Galatians 3:28.  In practical ways, how can we both show and practice the transcending power of the Gospel in our community? 
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. What is the common goal of fellowship? (v. 42, 46).  Read 1 Cor 12:4-20. According to this text, what is the purpose of the church’s unity and what marks a healthy body?  
{: .community-group-questions}

4\.  Fellowship, by definition, means to share one another’s burdens and to meet each other’s needs (v. 45).  Why is this so essential to the Gospel message? (Read Phil 2:3-8).  How can we become kinder and more generous?
