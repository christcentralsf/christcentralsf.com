##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\. Share some interesting things that people don't know about you.  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\. Jesus' first words to the disciples were "Come, follow me."  Then he made a practice of being with them.  What is the implication of Jesus' invitation and what do we learn about Christianity from his invitation? 
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. Jesus' last words, his promise to the disciples, were "Lo, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (v. 20).  What gospel truths do we learn from this and how is this personal to you?
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Read Gal 3:26-29.  Are you truly free in your sharing of the gospel, forging relationship with all with no barrier?  If now, what barriers hinder you the most?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

5\. The Gospel produces association, one's genuine relationship with others.  In what practical ways can you develop a true, gospel-centered relationship with others?  Share some practical commitments we can make as a CG.
