##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\. Think & share of a time when you felt like you 'belonged' to a group. What was the turning point when you realized you were accepted?
{: .community-group-questions}

2\.  Evangelism is a loaded term: What are your initial thoughts, impressions about evangelizing? What prevents us from it? What prompts us to it? 
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

3\.  Jesus had a strategy to evangelizing. Read Luke 6:12-16. What were some his initial steps & why?
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Before reaching the masses, Jesus selected the few. Who were these characters? How does that relate & apply to us today?
{: .community-group-questions}

5\. Luke 6:17-19 & 20-23, shows us Jesus' dual method of evangelism. How are these two elements important when we evangelize? Do we tend to emphasize one over the other? 
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions}

6\. We ALL feel unequipped to evangelize, but what are some ways we can learn, grow & pray for ourselves, in our CG's & for our neighbors?  
{: .community-group-questions}

7\. Personally & Privately: Pray for the 'select' few you want to share the Gospel with this week. Be aware of their specific concerns and needs. Learn how to share the hope that is in you.
