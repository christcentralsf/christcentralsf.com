##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions}

1\.  What makes life worth living?  "Everyone dies, but not everyone lives."  What is one thing that you want to say at the end of your journey in life?  
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions}

2\.  "Just as learning the “art” of any worthwhile craft takes time and effort, so the art of dying well requires our full attention. This does not mean we become fatalistic or develop an unhealthy fixation on death.  Rather, as believers, we abide in the knowledge that a good death is a culmination of a life lived for the glory of God – no matter what the length of that life may be. " (John Wesley).  Do you consider your life now to be a life living for the glory of God?  
{: .community-group-questions}

3\.  "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Phil 1:21).  What was Paul's understanding of life and death?   
{: .community-group-questions}

4\.  The Gospel promises eternal life to those who believe in Jesus.  If you were to truly believe in this, how will that impact your life now?   Consider C.S. Lewis' thoughts: “You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you."
