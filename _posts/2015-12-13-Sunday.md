1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. 8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 (John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.'") 16 For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.

##Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions .name}

2\. Christmas begins with the announcement of John, not Jesus' birth (Read Luke 1:5-38). What role does John play in preparation of Jesus' birth and why?  How did Mary rationalize her believe in the Christmas message? (v. 37).  What does that teach us regarding true faith? 
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. John was sent from God to be a witness.  What is a witness and what did John bear witness about?  (v, 15, vv, 29-30, and John 3:27-30).  So what does it mean to live as a true witness of Jesus?  
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. Consider John's life (John 3:4) and his death (Matt 14:1-12).  What will be the world's evaluation of John's life?  What was God's evaluation of John's life? (Read Matt 11:11).  Which one matters to you more, what the world says or what God says?
