##### Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions .name}

1\. Have you ever felt 'alone' in life? And have you ever felt/experienced a rescuing hand from someone? 
{: .community-group-questions}

##### Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions .name}

2\. The heart of Christmas is incarnation. What is the implication of 'the word became flesh'? (Read Phil 2:5-8)
{: .community-group-questions}

3\. The Word became flesh also means that he can now identify with our needs. He knows and has experienced all your needs in life. What comfort do you get from this truth? (Heb 4:14-16).
{: .community-group-questions}

4\. In Christianity, we get a person, not a theory. What is the distinction? What practical changes will take place when Jesus becomes an actual person rather than a theory that you follow?

##### Application
{: .community-group-questions .name}

5\. We, as Christians, must be the bearers of glad tidings. Whom do you desire to share the gospel during this Christmas? Let's prayerfully and desperately make this a priority.
