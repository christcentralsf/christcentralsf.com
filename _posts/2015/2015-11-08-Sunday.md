10 While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 11 And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, â€˜This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'" 12 When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." 14 And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, "Let the will of the Lord be done." 15 After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.

1)  Are you willing to suffer for the sake of the gospel?
{: .community-group-questions}

2)  If the things you hold most dear in the world were taken from you, would you turn your back on Jesus?
{: .community-group-questions}

3)  Rather than using wisdom, we usually want a simple, 10-step plant to how to live for God. We often do this, because we want to limit what God can ask from us. Do you try to manage what God can ask of you? In light of His grace, what are you willing to give Him?
{: .community-group-questions}

4)  Do you believe that Christ and His joy meets us in our suffering? Do you try to avoid it? If you lack joy in the Lord, is it because you don't trust Him with suffering?
