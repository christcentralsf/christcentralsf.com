For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentilesâ€” 2 assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, 3 how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. 4 When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5 which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 6 This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
{: .passage}

7 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. 8 To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9 and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, 10 so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 11 This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. 13 So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.

2) What is the mystery that Paul is alluding to? (v. 3, 4, 6). What is the significance of God's plan of salvation that includes the Gentiles?  
{: .community-group-questions}

3) Paul calls himself "the very least of all the saints" (v.8). And now read 1 Tim 1:12-16. Why does the Gospel produce this kind of reaction and confession in us? Do you share in Paul's confession? Why or why not?

4) What was the ultimate purpose of Paul's ministry? (v. 8, and v. 13). How did that impact and change Paul's current circumstance?
