11 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples 2 and said to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. 3 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’” 4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. 5 And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. 8 And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. 9 And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! 10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!”
{: .passage}

11 And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
{: .passage}

12 On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. 13 And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 14 And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.
{: .passage}

15 And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. 16 And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. 17 And he was teaching them and saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.”

## Getting to Know Me
{: .community-group-questions .name}

1)  Have you ever demonstrated a 'righteous anger?' What was the situation and/or circumstances? 
{: .community-group-questions}

## Into the Bible
{: .community-group-questions .name}

2) Read verses 1-6.  A full six verses are devoted to finding a colt for Jesus to ride.  Read Zechariah 9:9.  What does this teach us that Jesus has this so well planned out?  What are some practical, personal applications for us?
{: .community-group-questions}

3) Read verses 12-14 and 20-25.  Why does Jesus curse the fig tree? Since it is a 'living parable,' what does it mean for how we should live?
{: .community-group-questions}

4) Why does Jesus cleanse the temple in verses 12-19? What does it teach us about Jesus, ourselves, and the gospel?  How does this event relate to the cursing of the fig tree?
{: .community-group-questions}

## Application
{: .community-group-questions .name}

5) In verse 22 Jesus tells us to "have faith in God." According to the Heidelberg Catechism true faith has three elements: a KNOWING, a BELIEVING, and a TRUSTING. How can we continue to grow in these areas?
{: .community-group-questions}

6) The fruits of a Christian exhibit a life of prayer and acts of forgiveness. How can you demonstrate these fruits this week?
