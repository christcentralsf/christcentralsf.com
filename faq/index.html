      <h4>Who can I contact if I'm new to CCPC?</h4>
      <p>You can <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#contact">contact us</a>. Tell us about yourself, and on your first day at CCPC, look for the greeter or table with the Welcome sign directly after service. You'll meet other newcomers along with our Newcomer Committee. A free lunch will be waiting for you!</p>

      <p>Our vision is on our <a href="/vision">vision</a> page, and you can learn more about our reformed church from our denomination, the Korean American Presbyterian Church (KAPC), which adopted the twelve points of our faith, the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Westminster Larger Catechism, and the Book of Church Order.</p>

      <h4>What time is worship service at CCPC?</h4>
      <p>Our service at CCPC begins promptly at 9:50am every Sunday unless specified otherwise. We also have a college ministry, <a href="http://www.ficb.org/" target="_blank">Fellowship in Christ, Berkeley (FICB)</a>, that meet most Fridays on campus. Our Youth (high school students) meet most Friday nights downstairs at church.</p>

      <h4>How do I learn about upcoming events at CCPC?</h4>
      <p>There are many different events each month, but only four primary ways of staying in tune with these events at CCPC: [1] by reading the program available during Sunday service; [2] by reading our online <a href="/news">news</a>; [3] by joining a community group; and [4] by joining our mailing lists.</p>

      <h4>How do I remove myself from a CCPC mailing list?</h4>
      <p>We have two mailing lists: our <i>announce</i> mailing list is only used for official announcements and events while our <i>community</i> mailing list is used freely by all members of our congregation usually for housing, job searches, concerts, unofficial outings, etc. We discourage spam, solicitations, and meaningless chatter on both mailing lists. If you'd like to unsubscribe from either mailing address, we'd like to apologize for any inconvenience we've caused you. You can <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#contact">contact us</a> or unsubscribe by sending an e-mail from your subscribed address to <a href="mailto:community+unsubscribe@christcentralsf.com">community+unsubscribe@christcentralsf.com</a> and/or <a href="announce+unsubscribe@christcentralsf.com">announce+unsubscribe@christcentralsf.com</a>.</p>

      <h4>What name should we use? Christ Central or CCPC?</h4>
      <p>Though we use CCPC for convenience and brevity, we would prefer to be known as Christ Central as that lets people better know who we are.</p>
