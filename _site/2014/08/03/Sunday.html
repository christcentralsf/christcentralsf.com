            <p class="passage">10 Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. 11 And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.</p>

<p class="passage">12 And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?” 13 And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, 14 and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ 15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.” 16 And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.  </p>

<p class="passage">17 And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. 18 And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” 19 They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?” 20 He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. 21 For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”</p>

<p class="community-group-questions">1) Have you ever experienced intimate betrayal? Have you ever broken your promises?  </p>

<h2 class="community-group-questions name" id="into-the-bible">Into the Bible</h2>

<p class="community-group-questions">2) Consider Judas, one of the Twelve, who betrayed Jesus. Consider the disciples, including Peter, who denied and forsook Jesus. Now consider your own Christian life and commitment. Are we any better? Why do we betray and deny Jesus? What is the ultimate reason for our unfaithfulness? </p>

<p class="community-group-questions">3) Christianity is concerning Jesus, not who we are and what we do. What is the significance of the Lord’s supper? What is the promise of the new covenant?</p>

<p class="community-group-questions">4) What is the difference between Judas and Peter? Why was Peter not lost like Judas? Read Luke 22:31, 32.</p>

<p class="community-group-questions">5) Jesus tells his disciples that he would go before them to Galilee? What is the significance of Galilee?</p>

<h2 class="community-group-questions name" id="application">Application</h2>

<p class="community-group-questions">6) True motive for believers is gratitude. Those who are renewed and restored by God’s grace, like the disciples, will never be the same again. Where do you stand before the Lord? What is your commitment?</p>
