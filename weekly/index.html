    <h3>The Olive Leaf - April 4, 2020</h3>
    <div>
      <p>I confess that I’m not a natural “creative” type and so titles and names are the bane of my existence.  But, after much thought, I landed on “The Olive Leaf”. For starters, its foliage/botany connection presumes profundity and erudition.  More importantly, however, I think the allusion to Genesis 8 is an apt one.</p>
      <p>[6] At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made [7] and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. [8] Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. [9] But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. [10] He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. [11] And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. [12] Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore. Genesis 8:6–12 (ESV)</p>
      <p>We are now in our third week of mandated social distancing and it has left us scrambling to search for some semblance of sanity.  Normalcy is redefined and the menial is magnified.  I cannot even imagine the cabin (or ark) fever that Noah must have endured.  He was the original Tiger King.  </p>
      <p>The olive leaf was a sign that the waters have subsided but the earth was not quite ready to be inhabited. The waters may have subsided but the present reality is still hard to deal with. It is in that tension that we hope to encourage you.</p>
      <p>Waiting, as we know, builds character but it can also build frustration.  We try our best to patch up the leaks, not allowing the pent up rage to spill out onto our family and friends, but it is tremendously challenging.  </p>
      <p>I cannot wait until the day I can worship with my fellow brothers and sisters at Christ Central.  I cannot wait to resume our familial participation of the Lord’s Supper.  I cannot wait to sing worship songs with one voice.  But until then, I need something to hold me over.  I need a reminder.  </p>
      <p>And I hope that this, along with the podcasts and daily prayer challenges, can do just that for you. We are inundated with tragedy. We ingest the morsels of bad news on the daily.  However, in the deluge of said bad news, we want to offer up even better news: Christ has died and rose and we are forgiven and redeemed! There is nothing better.  No bad news can expel the light of the Gospel.  There will be a day when the waters will be completely subsided. Even when the eye of this particular storm passes (and it will), we are providentially comforted by the reminder that this too shall pass and that we look forward to the day when all things will be made new.</p>
