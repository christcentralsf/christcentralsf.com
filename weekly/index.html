    <h3>April 6, 2020</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Hello Christ Central Family,</p>
      <p>Music is a powerful tool where instruments and melodies do the talking. Just as we’ve heard yesterday, worship can be sung in any key as long as it’s directed honestly and openly to the Lord. So, the Praise Team have compiled a Praise Playlist specifically for this really hard season. We asked to our praise team members <em>“What worship songs have been encouraging you lately?”</em> They responded and picked out specific songs that proclaim the victory of Jesus, trusting in God’s sovereignty despite our fickle hearts, as well as desperation in unanswered grief yet praising the Father, Son & Holy Spirit. One quote from one of our praise team members: </p>
      <p><em>“I've been listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQl4izxPeNU" target="_blank">King of Kings by Hillsong</a> a lot. It was originally because I thought it was so fitting for Easter, but the more I listen to it, it's very pertinent in this chaos as well. Even in this uncertain and dark time, He is king of kings and we can find hope in a battle already won. </p>
      <p><strong>In the darkness, we were waiting<br/>
      without hope, without light<br/>
      Until from Heaven, you came running <br/>
      There was mercy in your eyes...”</strong></em></p>
      <p>Christ Central SF Fam, this Playlist is for you, from Praise Team. We are thinking of you. Use this setlist through the weeks as you cook, enjoy a drive, or want to personally worship in your home. We hope this will encourage you and please enjoy the variety of tones, musical genres, and styles. May you find a song in here that speaks, inspires and moves you to Worship our God who is for us. </p>
      <p><strong>Sincerely Christ Central Praise Team.</strong></p>

    <h3>The Olive Leaf - April 4, 2020</h3>
    <div>
      <p>By Pastor Jason</p>
      <p>I confess that I’m not a natural “creative” type and so titles and names are the bane of my existence.  But, after much thought, I landed on “The Olive Leaf”. For starters, its foliage/botany connection presumes profundity and erudition.  More importantly, however, I think the allusion to Genesis 8 is an apt one.</p>
      <p>[6] At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made [7] and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. [8] Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. [9] But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. [10] He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. [11] And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. [12] Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore. Genesis 8:6–12 (ESV)</p>
      <p>We are now in our third week of mandated social distancing and it has left us scrambling to search for some semblance of sanity.  Normalcy is redefined and the menial is magnified.  I cannot even imagine the cabin (or ark) fever that Noah must have endured.  He was the original Tiger King.  </p>
      <p>The olive leaf was a sign that the waters have subsided but the earth was not quite ready to be inhabited. The waters may have subsided but the present reality is still hard to deal with. It is in that tension that we hope to encourage you.</p>
      <p>Waiting, as we know, builds character but it can also build frustration.  We try our best to patch up the leaks, not allowing the pent up rage to spill out onto our family and friends, but it is tremendously challenging.  </p>
      <p>I cannot wait until the day I can worship with my fellow brothers and sisters at Christ Central.  I cannot wait to resume our familial participation of the Lord’s Supper.  I cannot wait to sing worship songs with one voice.  But until then, I need something to hold me over.  I need a reminder.  </p>
      <p>And I hope that this, along with the podcasts and daily prayer challenges, can do just that for you. We are inundated with tragedy. We ingest the morsels of bad news on the daily.  However, in the deluge of said bad news, we want to offer up even better news: Christ has died and rose and we are forgiven and redeemed! There is nothing better.  No bad news can expel the light of the Gospel.  There will be a day when the waters will be completely subsided. Even when the eye of this particular storm passes (and it will), we are providentially comforted by the reminder that this too shall pass and that we look forward to the day when all things will be made new.</p>

    <h3>A Silver Lining - March 28, 2020</h3>
    <div>
      <p>By Pastor Jason</p>
      <p>One of the silver linings of this COVID-19 situation is a deeper sense of gratitude for the things that I had taken granted for.  It has forced me to approach each day with more appreciation and it has sharpened my focus and specificity in my prayers. Our hope in producing more content like this is to cultivate a deeper doxological contemplation on God.  We pray that now, more than ever, your hearts can be stirred towards a more profound affection for Christ.  </p>
      <p>Seminary has given me many wonderful tools to become a better student of the Bible.  Although I appreciate the complexities of the languages and the depth of systematic theology, the one tool that has helped me the most is the four-part framework of God's redemptive work: Creation, Rebellion (Fall), Redemption, and Restoration (Consummation).  For me, everything else flowed from this lens in which I read the Bible.  </p>
      <p>So why do I mention this? </p>
      <p>I wanted to offer up a practical suggestion for those that are starting to (or already have started to) feel a bit stir crazy, being cooped up in your houses.  The days can get blended together and when structure and routine go out the proverbial window, one can easily lose focus and intentionality.   </p>
      <p>In an effort to provide a bit of direction in my own personal devotion to God, I’ve given myself some time to think, journal, and pray in this 4-part structure that has indelibly changed my theological foundation.  Each day, I journal and reflect on God through this format:</p>
      <p><strong>Creation:</strong> What are some things that I can give praise to God for?  What are some moments I enjoyed?  </p>
      <p><strong>Rebellion:</strong> What are some things I can grieve over?  What are some things I’ve done that are dishonoring/disobedient to God?  </p>
      <p><strong>Redemption:</strong> What truth about God, myself, or God working in this world encourages me today?  How does the Gospel encourage me in this specific moment in time? </p>
      <p><strong>Restoration:</strong> What gives me hope today?  What am I most thankful for today?</p>
      <p>I don't mean to offer up yet another pithy acronym to add to your litany of other catchphrases; rather, my hope and prayer is that in this short exercise of reflection you can see the conspicuous grace of God even in the menial and mundane. </p>
      <p>In the practice of using this framework to jot down these reflections, it has helped me to pay closer attention to each day and how God has worked in them.  I have been surprised by how much there is to celebrate but on the days when my spiritual needle hasn’t moved much, I can still be content in Christ and Christ alone.</p>
