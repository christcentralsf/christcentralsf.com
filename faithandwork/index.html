      <p><strong>We spend most of our life at work, but we often separate it from our faith.</strong> This year's conference will focus on the intersection of our work with our faith. Learn how faith should redefine our views on everyday aspects of our lives.</p>
      <p><strong>Join us Saturday and Sunday, February 24th and 25th.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.christcentralnetwork.com" target="_blank">Christ Central Network</a> exists to network, resource, and relationally support Asian-American pastors and ministry leaders who are planting and leading Gospel-centered churches and ministries.</p>
